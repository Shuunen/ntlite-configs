## Todo

- [ ] windows non-automatic updates is annoying, set it back to default (auto I guess)
- [ ] file deletion popup is annoying, set it back to defaults (no popup for standard deletion & popup for shift+delete I guess)
- [ ] webcam is not working... ?
- [ ] expanded icons with labels in taskbar are annoying, set it back to default (collapsed/small I guess)
